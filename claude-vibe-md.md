## 🎯 WHAT IS THIS?

A **real-time monitoring and alert system** that detects critical moments for animal activism and instantly notifies activists with actionable intelligence.

**Stop missing opportunities to save animals because you found out too late.**

### Core Mission
Enable activists to respond within **hours, not days** to:
- Animal deaths in captivity
- Circus arrivals and permits
- Abuse investigations
- Disease outbreaks
- Legislative changes
- Transport accidents

---

## 💔 THE PROBLEM

### Current Reality for Activists
```
Day 1: Animal dies in zoo
Day 3: Local news reports it
Day 5: Activist sees article on social media
Day 7: Activist tries to organize response
Day 10: Zoo's PR has controlled narrative
Day 14: Public has moved on

RESULT: No meaningful action taken
```

### Real Examples of Missed Opportunities

**Case 1: Calgary Zoo Gorilla (November 2024)**
- **What happened**: 2-year-old gorilla Eyare killed by human error (wrong door activated)
- **When activists learned**: 3-5 days after incident
- **Outcome**: Minimal protest, zoo called it "accident," continues normal operations
- **What could have been**: Immediate protest demanding safety review + independent audit

**Case 2: Valencia Circus Authorization (December 2025)**
- **What happened**: City reversed 10-year ban, authorized circus with animals
- **When activists learned**: After permit was granted
- **Outcome**: 1,000+ online complaints but circus opening anyway
- **What could have been**: Mobilization BEFORE permit granted, pressure during city council vote

**Case 3: Arizona Zoo Bird Flu (December 2024)**
- **What happened**: 5 animals dead from avian influenza, facility stayed open
- **When activists learned**: Through national news (late)
- **Outcome**: No demand for closure or investigation
- **What could have been**: Immediate pressure to close facility, CDC complaint filed

### The Data Gap

- **75%** of zoo animal deaths never make national news
- **Municipal circus permits** granted with 48-72 hour public notice
- **Disease outbreaks** in facilities often not disclosed until weeks later
- **Transport accidents** underreported by 60%+

**Activists are always playing catch-up.**

## 🎯 WHAT IS THIS?

A **real-time monitoring and alert system** that detects critical moments for animal activism and instantly notifies activists with actionable intelligence.

### Why This Matters

**Current Reality:**
```
Day 1:  Animal dies in zoo
Day 3:  Local news reports it
Day 5:  Activist sees article on social media
Day 7:  Activist tries to organize response
Day 10: Zoo's PR has controlled narrative
Day 14: Public has moved on

RESULT: No meaningful action taken
```

**With This System:**
```
Hour 0:  Event occurs
Hour 1:  System detects via monitoring
Hour 2:  Event classified and verified
Hour 3:  Alert sent to nearby activists
Hour 4:  Activists coordinating response
Hour 6:  Protest organized / pressure campaign begun

## 💔 THE PROBLEM

### Real Examples of Missed Opportunities

#### **Case 1: Calgary Zoo Gorilla (November 2024)**
- **What happened**: 2-year-old gorilla Eyare killed by human error (wrong door activated)
- **When activists learned**: 3-5 days after incident
- **Outcome**: Minimal protest, zoo called it "accident," continues normal operations
- **What could have been**: Immediate protest demanding safety review + independent audit

#### **Case 2: Valencia Circus Authorization (December 2025)**
- **What happened**: City reversed 10-year ban, authorized circus with animals
- **When activists learned**: After permit was granted
- **Outcome**: 1,000+ online complaints but circus opening anyway
- **What could have been**: Mobilization BEFORE permit granted, pressure during city council vote

#### **Case 3: Arizona Zoo Bird Flu (December 2024)**
- **What happened**: 5 animals dead from avian influenza, facility stayed open
- **When activists learned**: Through national news (late)
- **Outcome**: No demand for closure or investigation
- **What could have been**: Immediate pressure to close facility, CDC complaint filed

### The Data Gap

- **75%** of zoo animal deaths never make national news
- **Municipal circus permits** granted with 48-72 hour public notice

- **Transport accidents** underreported by 60%+
- **3,000-5,000 animals** killed in European zoos EVERY YEAR (EAZA data)

   Estimado/a [Nombre],
   
   Le escribo como ciudadano/a de Valencia profundamente 
   preocupado/a por la decisión de autorizar el Circ de Nadal 
   con animales.
   
   En 2015, nuestra ciudad tomó la decisión correcta de prohibir 
   los circos con animales. Esta reversión es inaceptable porque:
   
   1. Contradice 10 años de progreso en bienestar animal
   2. Ignora más de 1,000 quejas ciudadanas
   3. Va contra la tendencia europea (muchos países los prohíben)
   4. Enseña a los niños que el sufrimiento animal es aceptable
   
   Exijo que vote a favor de revocar este permiso inmediatamente.
   
   Espero su respuesta antes del 20 de diciembre.
   
   Atentamente,

### Data Flow Example
```
1. NEWS PUBLISHED
   "Zoo announces death of gorilla during routine procedure"
   Published: December 19, 2025, 2:00 PM

2. SCRAPER DETECTS (within 30 minutes)
   Keyword match: "zoo" + "death" + "gorilla"
   Source credibility: High (major news outlet)
   Initial confidence: 85%

3. NLP EXTRACTION
   Facility: Calgary Zoo
   Animal: Western Lowland Gorilla, female, 2 years
   Cause: Human error (wrong door activated)
   Location: 51.0447° N, 114.0719° W
   Date: November 20, 2024

4. ENRICHMENT
   Add from database:
   • Zoo contact info (phone, email)
   • Facility history (previous incidents)
   • Relevant laws (Alberta Animal Protection Act)
   • Media contacts (Calgary journalists)
   • Similar cases (pattern analysis)

5. CLASSIFICATION
   Type: Death in Captivity
   Urgency: CRITICAL (🔴)
   Reason: Recent (2h), human error, accreditation implications
   Target radius: 100km

6. ACTIVIST MATCHING
   Query: Activists within 100km of 51.0447° N, 114.0719° W
   Filters: Opted-in for "zoo deaths", active status
   Results: 14 activists matched

7. TEMPLATE GENERATION
   Generate custom alert with:
   • Event-specific details
   • Local contact information
   • Relevant legal context
   • Protest logistics (meeting point, time)
   • Pre-written letters/posts

8. MULTI-CHANNEL DISPATCH
   SMS: 14 activists (critical alert)
   Push: 14 activists
   Email: 14 activists (detailed version)
   Telegram: Post to Calgary Animal Rights group
   
9. GROUP COORDINATION
   Create temporary Telegram group: "Calgary Zoo Eyare Response"
   Auto-invite all 14 activists
   Post action plan and coordination info

10. TRACKING & UPDATES
    Monitor:
    • Activist response rate
    • Petition signatures
    • Media coverage
    • Facility response
    • Legislative action
    
    Provide updates to activists as situation evolves
```
