## 📡 The Concept
**Latent OSINT Globe** is a futuristic, immersive visualization tool designed to track and display global activism, climate events, and conflict data in real-time. 

Built with an **Advanced Tactical aesthetic**, it transforms raw data into a tactical "Neural Link" interface, allowing analysts and users to monitor planetary events through a "Latent" view—where data is not just read, but experienced.

## 🧠 Intelligent Activism IRL (Vegan & Eco Defense)
**ACTIVSINT** isn't just a map; it's a tool for **Intelligent Activism**. By leveraging OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), we provide:
-   **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive notification vectors when animal rights violations or ecological crises are detected in your sector.
-   **Mobilization Simulator**: Our "If/Then" logic helps you understand where your presence can have the most impact (e.g., *Protests in your city*).
-   **Vegan Advocacy Data**: Specific tracking of animal welfare incidents to coordinate rapid responses for the voiceless.

## 🧠 Intelligent Activism Protocol (IAP) // Vegan Defense
**ACTIVSINT** operates on the "Intelligent Activism" principle: **Data is the first line of defense.**

### 🌿 The Vegan Approach
We utilize technology to amplify the voice of the voiceless.
1.  **Cruelty-Free Code**: Our development lifecycle prioritizes energy efficiency (Green Computing) to minimize the carbon footprint of digital activism.
2.  **Ethical Data Sourcing**: We aggregate data from non-intrusive public signals (NASA, GDELT, Verified RSS) to track:
    -   *Illegal Poaching Vectors*
    -   *Factory Farming Expansion*
    -   *Habitat Destruction Events*
3.  **Mobilization Vectors**: The system aligns user geolocation with nearby advocacy events, turning *passive observation* into *active defense*.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture (Deep Dive)
### 🖥️ Client-Side Optimized Core
-   **Engine**: `react-globe.gl` (Three.js wrapper) with aggressive **Occlusion Culling** and **Geometry Instancing** to maintain 60FPS even with 500+ nodes.
-   **State Management**: React 19 optimized hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) ensuring zero unnecessary re-renders during high-frequency data updates.
-   **Bundle Strategy**: Vite-powered code splitting separates the 'Tactical HUD' from the '3D Core', allowing for instant interactions while assets stream in.

### 📡 Data Ingestion Pipeline
-   **EONET Proxy**: Serverless edge functions (`/api/rss`) scrub and normalize NASA geospatial data before it hits the client.
-   **Vector Search (Upcoming)**: Integration with **Weaviate** to allow semantic queries like *"Show me where deforestation overlaps with cattle ranching"* using localized ML models.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
-   **Client-Side Geolocation**: User location data is processed ephemeral in-memory and **NEVER** stored or transmitted to a central server.
-   **Anonymized Agents**: The "Activist Layer" simulations use fully anonymized, randomized coordinate jitter to protect the identity of simulated field agents.

## ⚡ Deployment
### Vercel / Netlify
The project is configured for single-page application (SPA) deployment.
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
# Output directory: /dist
```

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silkux/activsint.git
cd activsint
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
