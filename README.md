## 📡 The Concept
**Latent OSINT Globe** is a futuristic, immersive visualization tool designed to track and display global activism, climate events, and conflict data in real-time. 

Built with an **Advanced Tactical aesthetic**, it transforms raw data into a tactical "Neural Link" interface, allowing analysts and users to monitor planetary events through a "Latent" view—where data is not just read, but experienced.

## 🚀 Features
-   **3D Geospatial Engine**: Powered by `react-globe.gl` and Three.js.
-   **Real-Time Data Feed**: Live connection to NASA's EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker).
-   **Tactical UI**: Custom Neon interface with CRT scanlines, holographic grids, and 'Orbitron' typography.
-   **Tactical HUD**: Heads-Up Display for event metrics, data inspection, and system status.
-   **Performance Optimized**: Capable of rendering live datasets without browser saturation via memoization and geometric simplification.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
-   **Core**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite
-   **3D/Viz**: React Globe GL, Three.js, D3 Scale
-   **Styling**: TailwindCSS (v4), Custom CSS Variables (Neon Palette)
-   **State/Data**: React Hooks, Fetch API

## ⚡ Deployment
### Vercel / Netlify
The project is configured for single-page application (SPA) deployment.
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
# Output directory: /dist
```

### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/silkux/activsint.git
cd activsint
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## 🔮 Roadmap
-   [x] **Phase 1**: Core Engine & NASA Integration (Complete)
-   [x] **Phase 2**: Visual Interface Overhaul (Complete)
-   [ ] **Phase 3**: RSS News Integration (In Progress)
-   [ ] **Phase 4**: "Ask Weaviate" RAG Interface (Planned)
