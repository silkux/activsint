# 🧠 Project Vision: The Latent Globe

## 1. The Core Idea
In an age of information overload, raw lists of data are insufficient. We need **Visceral Intelligence**. The "Latent Globe" is an attempt to visualize the "pulse" of the planet—activism, climate change, and conflicts—not as a spreadsheet, but as a living, breathing digital organism.

The term **"Latent"** refers to the hidden patterns in the data that become visible only when visualized globally.

## 2. Aesthetic Philosophy: "Vaporwave / Cyberpunk"
The design choice is intentional. By using a **Dark Mode / Neon** aesthetic:
-   **High Contrast**: Critical events (red/magenta) stand out instantly against the deep void (indigo/black).
-   **Gamification**: The "Tactical HUD" feel encourages users to explore the data like players in a game or operators in a sci-fi command center.
-   **Immersion**: CRT scanlines and grid effects simulate a direct connection to a raw satellite feed, increasing the feeling of "liveness".

## 3. Data Architecture (Planned)
Currently, the system relies on **NASA EONET** for verifiable environmental data.
Future expansions will include:
-   **RSS Proxy**: Aggregating news from decentralized activist blogs to bypass censorship.
-   **Weaviate Vector Store**: A "Knowledge Graph" that allows users to ask questions like *"Where are the water protests?"* and see the answer light up on the globe.

## 4. User Experience Flow
1.  **Boot Sequence**: The user is greeted with a terminal-style "System Initialization" to build anticipation.
2.  **The Overview**: A rotating 3D Earth shows the distribution of events (Heatmap).
3.  **The Inspection**: Hovering over points reveals "Data Nodes"—specific metadata about the event.
4.  **The Deep Dive**: Clicking "Access Explorer" drops the user into a traditional dashboard for granular analysis.
